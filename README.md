The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.
